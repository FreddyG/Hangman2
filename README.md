Hangman app

The evil hangman app will implement a hangman game using an algorithm to constantly “change” the solution, least favourable to the user.

Features:

-screen displaying the progress
-possibility to give input to the program
-algorithm for the evil side of hangman
-button to change the app from evil to normal or normal to evil
–restart/ new game button
-exit button

Extra features:

-maybe a fancy way to give output( like a pop up)
-highscores( 1: won the game in … moves)

Frameworks,languages,libraries or other technologies:

-will need to use a library of every 7 letter word
-language will be java for android
-something to search quickly trought the huge library (hashtable) 
-7 libraries stored of being sorted alphabetically on the first letter, the second letter, … till the seventh letter (may become handy for the algorithm)
-using a known algorithm to quickly search how much possibilities an answer contains

Mockups of the screens:
See file “design_app”. This will be the only screen on the app. Restart will refresh the screen with zero guesses made.

Evil is a toggle: If pressed a pop up will appear to confirm the switch, if pressed yes the screen will refresh with zero guesses made, just like restart.

Who will do what:
I will be working alone.
